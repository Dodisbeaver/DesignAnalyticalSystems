md`# REFUGEES | Data filtration

Refugees are people who have fled war, violence, conflict or persecution and have crossed an international border to find safety in another country. They often have had to flee with little more than the clothes on their back, leaving behind homes, possessions, jobs and loved ones. 


Data source: [UNHCR - The UN Refugee Agency](https://www.unhcr.org/about-us.html)`


I filter the data in arquero to work later on with d3 in the interactive map
link to observable.

I worked on this for quite some time but not enough. It is not finished. I am not satisfied with the outcome. But I will try and improve when I have the time.

I got the interactive map working. And a somewhat functioning timeline. I did not have enough time left for the buttons.
